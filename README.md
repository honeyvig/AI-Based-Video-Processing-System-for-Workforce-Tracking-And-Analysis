--------------
To develop the AI-powered video processing software for factory personnel activity tracking, we can break down the project into several main components and focus on the AI model for activity classification, camera integration, data processing, real-time reporting, and alerts. Below is a simplified Python-based approach to building a basic prototype for this system, which would work as a foundation for the final application.

The main tasks include:

    Real-time video processing and analysis using existing IP cameras.
    Activity classification (detecting work-related tasks and non-work-related activities like mobile phone usage and idle time).
    Generating reports based on analysis.

We'll leverage OpenCV for video processing and object detection, TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI-based activity classification, and Flask or Django for building a web interface to show results. The prototype will focus on the core logic.
Step 1: Setup Dependencies

To run the code, you'll need to install several libraries:

pip install opencv-python tensorflow flask pyttsx3 pandas

Step 2: Video Stream Processing (Using OpenCV)

We can use OpenCV to capture video streams from IP cameras. This assumes you can connect to an IP camera that streams video in a standard format (e.g., MJPEG, RTSP).

import cv2

def capture_video_from_camera(camera_url):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(camera_url)

    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Unable to access camera.")
        return

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            print("Error: Failed to capture image.")
            break
        
        # Display the video frame
        cv2.imshow("Live Video Feed", frame)
        
        # Press 'q' to quit
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Example: Replace with your camera URL (e.g., RTSP stream or IP camera URL)
camera_url = 'rtsp://<camera_ip_address>:<port>/stream'
capture_video_from_camera(camera_url)

Step 3: Activity Classification with AI

In the context of the factory, we need an AI model that can detect and classify various activities, such as "soldering," "cable cutting," or "mobile phone use." You can fine-tune an existing model (like MobileNet, YOLO, or Faster R-CNN) for task classification.

Hereâ€™s an example using a pre-trained model with TensorFlow to detect objects that can be extended to classify tasks:

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for object detection
model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')

def classify_activity(frame):
    # Preprocess the frame for MobileNetV2
    img = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    img = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(img)

    # Predict the class of the image
    predictions = model.predict(img)
    decoded_predictions = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.decode_predictions(predictions)

    # Output the prediction (top prediction)
    print(f"Prediction: {decoded_predictions[0][0][1]} with confidence: {decoded_predictions[0][0][2]:.2f}")

# Test the function on a captured frame
frame = cv2.imread('example_image.jpg')  # Replace with an actual image
classify_activity(frame)

This is a simplified example where we use MobileNetV2 to classify objects. For a more sophisticated task, you would want to use a custom-trained model to recognize tasks like cable cutting, soldering, etc., and detect behaviors like mobile phone usage and idle behavior.
Step 4: Idle Detection and Mobile Phone Detection

Detecting non-work activities such as mobile phone usage can be done through object detection and pose recognition. Using frameworks like OpenPose for detecting poses or utilizing a custom-trained model for detecting objects (e.g., mobile phones), you can classify the behavior.
Step 5: Real-Time Reporting and Alerts

To track employee activity over time, store the results in a database or a data structure. You can trigger alerts when abnormal activities (like excessive idle time or mobile phone use) are detected.

Here's an example using pandas to track employee activities:

import pandas as pd
import time

# Dataframe to store employee activities
columns = ['Employee_ID', 'Task', 'Time_Spent', 'Activity', 'Timestamp']
activity_log = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns)

def log_activity(employee_id, task, activity, time_spent):
    timestamp = time.time()  # Current time
    new_log = pd.DataFrame([[employee_id, task, time_spent, activity, timestamp]], columns=columns)
    global activity_log
    activity_log = pd.concat([activity_log, new_log], ignore_index=True)

    # Save the log to a file or database
    activity_log.to_csv("activity_log.csv", index=False)

# Example logging function
log_activity(1, 'Soldering', 'Working', 120)  # 120 seconds working
log_activity(1, 'Idle', 'Idle', 300)  # 300 seconds idle
log_activity(1, 'Mobile Usage', 'Mobile Phone Use', 60)  # 60 seconds mobile phone use

Step 6: Web Dashboard

For real-time monitoring and reporting, you can use Flask to create a web dashboard. The dashboard would display the current activity, time spent on tasks, and other metrics.

from flask import Flask, render_template
import pandas as pd

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Read the latest activity log
    activity_log = pd.read_csv('activity_log.csv')
    return render_template('dashboard.html', tables=[activity_log.to_html(classes='data')], titles=activity_log.columns.values)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 7: Generating Reports

After processing the data, you can generate reports based on the logs:

def generate_report():
    activity_log = pd.read_csv("activity_log.csv")
    
    # Example report: Time spent on each task
    report = activity_log.groupby(['Task'])['Time_Spent'].sum()
    report.to_csv('task_report.csv', index=True)

    print("Report Generated: task_report.csv")

Step 8: Alert System (Email Notifications)

You can use the smtplib library to send emails when idle time or mobile phone usage exceeds a threshold:

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_alert(email_recipient, subject, body):
    email_sender = "youremail@example.com"
    email_password = "yourpassword"

    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = email_sender
    msg['To'] = email_recipient
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    # Send the email
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(email_sender, email_password)
        text = msg.as_string()
        server.sendmail(email_sender, email_recipient, text)
        server.quit()
        print("Alert sent!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending email: {e}")

# Example of sending an alert for excessive idle time
send_alert("manager@example.com", "Alert: Idle Time Exceeded", "Employee 1 has been idle for 300 seconds.")

Conclusion:

This is a basic prototype that can track employee activities in a factory setting using existing cameras and AI-based image processing. The full solution will need to:

    Improve object and action classification accuracy.
    Implement a more sophisticated alert system based on behavior patterns.
    Develop real-time video analysis.
    Integrate with factory systems for employee identification.

Further steps would involve enhancing the AI model (perhaps with deep learning for better accuracy), adding multi-camera support, optimizing the system for real-time processing, and creating detailed visual reports for managers.
